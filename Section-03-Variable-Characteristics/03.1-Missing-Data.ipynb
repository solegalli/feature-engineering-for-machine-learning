    "# Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data is the absence of values in certain observations of a variable. Missing data is an unavoidable problem in most data sources and may have a significant impact on the conclusions that we derived from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is the data missing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of missing data can vary. These are just some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value was forgotten, lost, or not stored properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value can't be known or identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give real-life examples, a person may choose not to complete all fields in a form if they are not mandatory. That would introduce missing data. Sometimes people do not want to disclose some information, for example, income, or they do not know the answers to the questions being asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the value for a certain variable does not exist. For example, in the variable \"total debt as percentage of total income\" (very common in financial data), if the person has no income, then the total percentage of 0 does not exist, and therefore it will be a missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand why data is missing, in other words, the mechanism of missing data. We may process the missing information differently depending on this mechanism. Furthermore, identifying the source of missing data allows us to take steps to regulate that source and reduce the amount of missing data as data collection progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing data mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 mechanisms that lead to missing data. Two of them involve missing data randomly and the third one involves a systematic loss of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Completely at Random, MCAR:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the likelihood of a value being missing is the same for all observations, the variable is missing completely at random (MCAR). The data points that are missing are a random subset of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If data is MCAR, then disregarding observations with missing data would not bias the inferences made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing at Random, MAR: \n",
    "\n",
    "If the probability of an observation being missing depends on available information (i.e., other variables), then the observation is missing at random (MAR). There is a relationship between the likelihood of a value being missing and the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR. The weight information will be missing at random for the men and women who did not disclose their weight, but as men are more prone to disclose it, there will be more missing values for women than for men.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, missing data points are no longer a random subset of the total observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide to proceed with the variable with missing values (in this case weight), we might want to include the variable gender to control the bias in weight for the missing observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Not at Random, MNAR: \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a mechanism or a reason why data is missing, then that data is missing not at random (MNAR). For example, if people failed to fill out a depression survey because of their depression, those data points would be missing not at random. The missing data occurs due to the depression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the mechanism by which missing values occur, we may choose different missing data imputation methods."
