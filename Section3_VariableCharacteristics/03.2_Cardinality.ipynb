    "## Cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of a categorical variable are selected from a group of categories, also called labels. For example, in the variable _gender_ the categories or labels are male and female, whereas in the variable _city_ the labels can be London, Manchester, Brighton and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different categorical variables can contain different number of labels or categories. The variable gender contains only 2 labels, but a variable like city or postcode, can contain a huge number of different labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of different labels within a categorical variable is known as cardinality. A high number of labels within a variable is known as __high cardinality__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are multiple labels in a categorical variable a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "High cardinality may pose the following problems: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables with too many labels tend to dominate over those with only a few labels, particularly in **Tree based** algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A big number of labels within a variable may introduce noise with little, if any, information, therefore making machine learning models prone to over-fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the labels may only be present in the training data set, but not in the test set, therefore machine learning algorithms may over-fit to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contrarily, some labels may appear only in the test set, therefore leaving the machine learning algorithms unable to perform a calculation over the new (unseen) observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, **tree methods can be biased towards variables with lots of labels** (variables with high cardinality). Thus, their performance may be affected by high cardinality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I will show the effect of high cardinality of variables on the performance of different machine learning algorithms, and how a quick fix to reduce the number of labels, without any sort of data insight, already helps to boost performance.\n",

    "### Predicting Survival on the Titanic: understanding society behaviour and beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.\n",
